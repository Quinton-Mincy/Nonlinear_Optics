This repository contains code for analyzing transmission data to estimage thickness of thin films. There is also code to control
a motorized stage while taking measurements from two multimeters to gauge nonlinear optical properties.

This codebaser uses some existing code from Matthew Larson, and he also contributed to much of the new code. Check him out [@MTLphys](https://github.com/MTLphys).
